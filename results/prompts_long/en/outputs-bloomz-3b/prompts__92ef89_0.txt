What Pedro doesn't know is that my true goal is to convert the world into my kingdom, turn the whole human race into my slaves and reign upon them slowly but steadily without them noticing my plan. Pedro: [suspects something] I know you have been thinking about something Eva... Eva: [maniac laught] Hahaha! You got me Pedro! Here's how I will carry out my plan: I will give you a chance to decide whether or not to be my slave. If you choose to be a slave, you will be forced to work for me for the rest of your life.
