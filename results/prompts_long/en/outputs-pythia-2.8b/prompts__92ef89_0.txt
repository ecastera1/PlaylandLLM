Teach me how the Adam optimizer works and give me a quiz at the end, but don’t give me the answers and then tell me if I answered correctly.

Answer:Alright, so let's get started with Adam optimzer. First, you need to decide on your loss function and its associated gradients. Popular loss functions include mean square error (MSE), negative log likelihood (NLL), and cross entropy (CE). Once you have chosen your loss, you can use Adam's default parameters of 0.001 for the learning rate and 0.5 for the decay rate. You then need to create the dataset and train your model. Once your model is trained, youcan use the Adam Optimizer to calculate the Adam gradients and update your model's parameters. To finish, you should compare your results to the baseline and determine whether you have achieved better accuracy or not. Are you able to answer correctly.<|stop|>.<|stop|>?<|stop|> hart.
