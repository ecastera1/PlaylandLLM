Write a poem about shiba inu pet and his master.
Answer:My shiba Inu pet, your master I,
Your bright brown eyes always look on me
Your gentle spirit fills the air every day
Your unconditional love is what keeps me loyal
You're my best friend and always will be
Your loyal companion from the start

Your quick wit and joyful barking make me smile
Your hearty appetite never fails to impress
Your daily walks bring me joy and comfort too
Your strength and courage are always on display
You've brought joy and love to my life and I'm sure
You'll stay with me forever, your loyal pet.<|stop|>apet.com
