The Adam optimize tries to find the optimal solution for a given problem by minimizing the total cost of the product or services. The algorithm calculates the total costs of the products or services and uses this information to find a solution that is the least expensive. The goal of Adam optimize is to find an optimal solution that minimizes the cost of all the products in the system. The first step in Adam optimize involves calculating the total number of products or customers. Then, the Adam optimize algorithm calculate the total total cost by dividing the total amount of products by the total quantity of products. This is done by calculating a cost function that takes into account the total sales, profits, and costs of all products or service that are in the same category. The total cost is then multiplied by the cost function to find how much the total price of the goods or services is. Once the total expense is calculated, the algorithm calculate an optimal cost function by determining the total revenue or profit for each product or customer. The cost function is then used
