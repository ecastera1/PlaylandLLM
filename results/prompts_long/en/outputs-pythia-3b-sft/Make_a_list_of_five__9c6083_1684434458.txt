### output 1
Make a list of five Intel CPU features that can help run modern software and improve user experience.

- Intel Turbo Boost technology: This technology allows the processor to automatically adjust its clock speed based on the system's workload. This can improve performance and responsiveness.
- Hyper-threading: This feature allows the CPU to run two threads at the same time, which can improve the performance of multithreaded applications.
 - Intel Virtualization Technology: This allows the operating system to run multiple virtual operating systems on the same physical hardware, which improves the performance and reliability of software running in a virtual environment.
  - Intel Virtual Technology Extensions (VT-x): This feature enables the processor's virtualization capabilities, which allows the software to run on the CPU without the need for a separate virtualization layer.
   - Intel Parallel Processing Technology (IntelÂ® Advanced Vector Extensions, or AVX): This allows for the processor and the operating systems to perform complex calculations in parallel, which helps improve the speed and performance of certain applications and programs.
    - Intel Quick Sync Video Technology (QSV): This technology can improve user experiences by reducing the lag time between the processor processing a frame and the display showing it to the user.
