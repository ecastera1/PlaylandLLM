Create a fictional magical system that is based on thermodynamic principles. This system would have a set of rules that govern the interactions between the different components of the system. The system would be governed by a set number of variables, such as temperature, pressure, and volume. The variables would be subject to a set set of constraints, such that the system would not exceed or violate any of the constraints.

The system would also have a number of components, such a gas, liquid, solid, and plasma. Each component would have its own set of variables and constraints. The interactions between components would be based on the conservation of energy.
A key concept in this system is that of entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. It is a function of the number of possible states of a given system and the number that are actually realized. The greater the number realized, the lower the entropy. The entropy of a closed system is always a maximum.
An example of a fictional system that uses thermodynamic principles is the "Pandora's Box" system. This fictional system is based around a box of gas that is sealed. The box is subject to pressure, temperature, and entropy constraints. If the box is opened, the gas will
