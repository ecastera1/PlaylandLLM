Describe what is quantum computing and it possible outcomes.

Quantum computing is the study of how to use quantum mechanics to solve problems that would be extremely difficult or impossible to solve using classical computing.
Quantum computers can perform certain tasks much faster than classical computers, such as factoring large numbers or simulating quantum systems.
However, quantum computers are not yet widely available, and the practical applications of quantum computing are still being explored.
Some possible outcomes of quantum computers include:

- Quantum computers could be used to solve certain problems that are too complex for classical computers.
- It is possible that quantum computers could one day be used for large-scale simulations of complex physical systems. 
- Some quantum computers might be used in the future to develop new drugs or other technologies.
There are many other possible outcomes as well.
It is important to note that quantum computing is still in its early stages, and there are many challenges that need to be overcome before it can be widely used.
