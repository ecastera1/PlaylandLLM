Describe a terrible hangover using the language of an English aristocrat from the Renaissance.

I am an English nobleman from the early Renaissance period. I am not accustomed to drinking alcohol, and I am shocked to discover that my body has been transformed into an unending series of debilitating headaches, nausea, and dizziness.
I have been unable to sleep for days, and my body is aching with the pain of my injuries. I have been drinking a great deal of water, but the water has not helped my condition.
My head feels like it is filled with a thousand tiny knives, and the pain is so intense that I cannot take a single step without feeling a sharp stab in my head.
The pain is unbearable, and it is difficult to focus on anything. I cannot think clearly, and am unable to remember anything that has happened in the past few days.
It is as if I am trapped in a nightmare, and there is nothing I can do to escape.
But I am determined to survive this ordeal, and will do everything possible to overcome my terrible hangovers.
Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
The English Aristocrat from Renaissance England
