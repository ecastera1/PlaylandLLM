Create a fictional magical system that is based on thermodynamic principles.

Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of heat and work. It is concerned with energy transformations and how energy flows through a system. Thermodynamics provides a quantitative framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy, and is applicable to all natural phenomena.
In this fictional magical practice, we will explore the use of thermodynamics to create a magical system.
Thermo-magical practices are based on the premise that magical energy is a manifestation of heat, and that the universe operates according to thermodynamic laws. Thermo-magic is based upon the premise of the conservation of energy, the second law of thermodynamic, and the principle of entropy. Thermomagical systems are designed to harness the magical energy of heat. Thermopower is the ability of a material to convert thermal energy into electrical energy. Thermoreceptors are the receptors that detect thermal energy.
The second law states that entropy always increases in a closed system, which means that energy is lost. Entropy is a measure of disorder, or randomness. Entropic forces are those that oppose order and oppose change. Thermosensitive materials are materials that are sensitive to thermal energy, such
