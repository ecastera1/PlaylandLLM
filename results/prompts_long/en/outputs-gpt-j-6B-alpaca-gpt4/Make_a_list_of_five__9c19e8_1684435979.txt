Make a List of Five Stable Diffusion Features That Should Improve to Make Inference Faster

Stable Diffusions

The Stable-Diffusion model is a variant of the Diffusion model. It is a Gaussian Process regression model with a Gauss-Hermite basis expansion. The basis expansion is a truncated series of Hermite polynomials. The coefficients of the basis expansion are learned using a Gaussion Process regression. The Stable diffusion model uses a truncation threshold to control the number of basis expansion coefficients. The threshold is learned using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
The model is trained using the Gaussian process regression algorithm. The algorithm uses the variational inference algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The variational algorithm uses a Gaussia Process approximation to the posterior.
Inference is done using the variate approximation algorithm. It uses the Gaussia process approximation to approximate a Gausssian process posterior distribution. The posterior distribution is approximated using a variate Gaussian distribution.
Unlike the Diffusions model, the Stable model does not use a truncate basis expansion to approximate posterior
