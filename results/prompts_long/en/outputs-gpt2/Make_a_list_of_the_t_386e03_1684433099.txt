Make a list of the top five common mistakes when trading futures and how to avoid them.

1) Don't buy and sell.
...

If you're buying a futures contract, you probably have a lot of options. But if you're selling a futures, you'll probably need to buy and hold more than one.
 (If you don't, you can buy and trade at any time.)

So if you want to buy a futures and sell it, you need to know what you're doing.
- - - -

You can buy a contract for $100,000 and sell the same for $50,000.
 and sell a contract, and sell $50 of it for $60,000, and you'll have $60 of it in your account.
, and your account is full.
:

.
 "I'm going to buy $100 of $50 in 10 minutes."

-

"I'm buying $50 worth of $60 worth of futures."
. "I'll buy $60 on the spot."
 (You can also buy and buy futures at any point in time.)


2) DonÂ´t buy and dump.
