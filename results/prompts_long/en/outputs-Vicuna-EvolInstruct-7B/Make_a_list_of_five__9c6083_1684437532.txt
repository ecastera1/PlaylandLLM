Make a list of five Intel CPU features that can help run modern software and improve user experience.

Answer: Here are five Intel® CPU features which can help you run modern applications and improve your user experience:

1. 64-bit Architecture: 6th generation Intel® Core™ processors support 667 TFLOPS of single precision floating-point performance, which can handle complex computational tasks.
2. Hyper-Threading Technology: Hyper-threading technology enables a single processor to handle multiple threads simultaneously, which improves the overall performance of the system.
3. Turbo Boost Technology: Turbo boost technology allows the processor to dynamically adjust the clock speed of cores to match the workload, resulting in improved performance.
4. Integrated Graphics: Integrated graphics on 6-generation Intel® processors can handle light gaming and video editing tasks, which reduces the need for an external graphics card.
5. Optane Memory: Optane memory is a new type of memory that can store data much faster than traditional RAM, which provides a significant boost in system performance.
