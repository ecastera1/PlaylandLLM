Describe a terrible hangover using the language of an English aristocrat from the Renaissance.

"I awoke this morning to find myself in a most unfortunate state, my lordship. The night before was most unruly, and I fear I have been the victim of a most regrettable bout of excess. The pains in my head and stomach are most unbearable, and my senses are most muddled. I fear that I have indeed been the subject of a terrible affliction, a most disgraceful malady that has left me in a state of utter disrepair. My lordship, I must beg your forgiveness, for I fear my conduct was most inappropriate and unseemly."
