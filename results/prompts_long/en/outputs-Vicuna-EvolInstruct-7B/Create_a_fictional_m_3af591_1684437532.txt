Create a fictional magical system that is based on thermodynamic principles.

I'm trying to create a fictitious magical world where magic is based upon thermodynamics. I'm having trouble coming up with a system that makes sense.
Any suggestions or ideas?

One idea I had was that magic is generated by the difference between heat energy and cold energy. The more heat energy there is, the more powerful the magic. This would mean that magic would be most powerful in warm areas, and less powerful in cold areas.
Also, the amount of heat energy would determine the strength of the spell, with stronger spells requiring more heat.
Another idea was that there are certain materials that can store heat energy, and these materials can be used to power magic. For example, a wizard could use a piece of iron to store heat and then release it to cast a spell.
Lastly, there could be certain creatures that are naturally gifted with the ability to generate heat energy. These creatures could be used as powerful wizards or witches.
I know this is a bit of a stretch, but any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you!
