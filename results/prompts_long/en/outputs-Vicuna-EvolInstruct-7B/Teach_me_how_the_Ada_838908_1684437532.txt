### output 1
Teach me how the Adam optimizer works and give me a quiz at the end, but don’t give me the answers and then tell me if I answered correctly.

Comment: @user1234567890 You don't need to worry about the answers, as you cannot cheat on the quiz. The Adam optimiser is a type of gradient descent optimiser used in machine learning. It works by computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the model, and then updating the parameters to minimise the loss. The quiz will help you understand how the optimiser works and how to interpret its output.
