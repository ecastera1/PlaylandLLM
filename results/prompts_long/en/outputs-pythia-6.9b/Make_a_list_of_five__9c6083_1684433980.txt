Ask YC: What are the best resources to learn web development. - jasonlbaptiste

I'm looking for some good resources to get started learning web development, especially for someone who isn't very experienced. I've heard of a few places like Codeacademy, W3Schools, and Treehouse, but was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions. Thanks.
