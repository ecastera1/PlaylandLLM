Write a poem about shiba inu pet and his master.
Answer:

Hear the thunder of the rain,
Dashing against the rooftop,
Breaking the silence of night,
Embracing the sorrow of pain.

See the lightning, strike the tree,
Splitting the branches in two,
Holding the fear in its hands,
Making the shiba Inu bark.
"I am the master and you are the slave," the thunder said. 
The lightning answered, "Yes, master." 
"You will do as I say," the lightning replied. 

The rain poured harder, washing away their sorrow and pain. 


The shiba looked up, content in his master's love. He knew he was safe and would be cared for. He also knew that his master was there for him, no matter the circumstance.<|stop|>burg poetical.<|stop|>berg's answer.<|stop|>'s answer.. - 2.
