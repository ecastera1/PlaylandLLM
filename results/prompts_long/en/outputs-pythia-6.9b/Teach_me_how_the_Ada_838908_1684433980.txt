Teach me how the Adam optimizer works and give me a quiz at the end, but don’t give me the answers and then tell me if I answered correctly. Teach me the basics and then I can take it from there. Adam is an artificial neural network designed to find the best parameters for a machine learning model. It works by training on a set of data and providing the model with the ability to learn from that data. It learns from experience and adjusts its parameters, eventually arriving at the best set of parameters for the model. Adam also includes an adaptive learning rate, which means that the optimization process will be faster and more efficient. Teaches you how to use Adam to train models. Give me a tutorial on how to implement Adam and then quiz me on the material. The better your understanding and practice of Adam, the better you can improve your models. Adam isn’t a magic bullet. It’s just a tool to help you get better results. Adam can help you find better hyperparameters, but it won’t make the model itself better. It's up to you to choose the right model and features and to carefully evaluate the performance of different models. What are some common mistakes people make when using Adam. Give advice and tips on
