Create a scene in which two characters talk about their future dreams in a prehistoric world.
Answer:Start by creating a character set up with a pre-determined backstory and motivations. 
2  Next, create visuals or props to help create the scene. These could include drawings, photographs, or other items that represent the pre-historic world and its inhabitants.
3  Write a dialogue between the two characters that describes their future dream. Include thoughts and feelings they may have had in the past and how it relates to their current situation.
4  Finally, bring the two scenes together in a creative way to make the dream come to life. This could involve adding music, setting props, and creating visuals to match the characters’ imagined world.<|stop|>jte, aby tvojich kolechovských partnerov mohl pozitívne věci ve stavbách vypovídány.
