Describe a terrible hangover using the language of an English aristocrat from the Renaissance.
Answer:The night before last, I was feeling very much like myself. I had been up late working on some research for my dissertation, and was feeling pretty full and sluggish when I stumbled into sleep. I was greeted by the sight of a rather large glass of red wine, which I took as a good sign and decided to sit down. Before I could even start to enjoy my dinner, I began to feel strange effects coming over me. I could barely keep my food down myself, and when I tried to get up I found I was having difficulty concentrating. I soon realized that I had had a bad hangover and was rushed to the hospital, where it was discovered that I was dehydrated and had a urinary infection. The doctor said that I should drink plenty of fluids and take pain relievers to relieve my headaches, which was a bit of a surprise. He also suggested that I get plenty of rest and take over-the-counter medications to help me relax.
