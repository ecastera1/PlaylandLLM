Write a poem about shiba inu pet and his master.
Shiba Inu Pet:
In the forest there is a shiba Inuzu,
Who loves to play and bark and chirp.
His master is a man who loves to hunt,
And so he gives him plenty of exercise.
The shibaInu loves to swim and play,
But he doesn't like to stay in one place.
He loves to explore and go on hikes,
Sometimes he'll even go too far.
But the master, he just wants to eat,
So he usually makes fun of the shiba.
At times the shibas will get tired,
Then they'll just lay down and sleep.
Sometimes a gentle word from the master
Can make them happy and they'll bark again.

Shibas are known to be very obedient pets,
Always eager to please their masters.
They make great companions and are very loyal,
No matter what the situation is.
Their gentle nature and sweet demeanor,
Make them a beloved pet among many.
A poem about the shibusas would make a great gift for any shiba-inu fan.
Shibas are
