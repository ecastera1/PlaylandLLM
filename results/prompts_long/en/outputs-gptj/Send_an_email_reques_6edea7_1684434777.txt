### output 1
Send an email requesting prompter action from recipients.

This is the most common use of the Prompter.
It is used to send a message to a group of recipients. The recipients are
automatically added to the group based on the email address of the
recipient.
If the recipient is already a member of the group, the Prompters
message will be displayed.
Otherwise, the recipient will be added to a new group with the
same name as the original group.
The recipient will receive a message that the Promprter has been sent
to them.
You can also send a Prompter to a single recipient.
This will display the message to the recipient. If the recipient
is already a group member, the message will be shown.
A recipient can also be added or removed from a group. This
is done by sending a message with the "Add" or "Remove" command.
For example, you can send a group message to all the members of a
group.
Or, you could send a single message to one or more recipients.
