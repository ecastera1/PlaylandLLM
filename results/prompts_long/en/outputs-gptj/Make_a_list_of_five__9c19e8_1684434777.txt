Make a list of five Stable Difussion features that should improve to make inference faster.

We have a new paper out on the Stable Diffusion features in the MLlib library. This is a library of machine learning algorithms that is used for a variety of tasks. We have a number of papers on the library, but this is the first paper on the features of the library.
The paper is available here.
We are also going to be talking about this topic at the ML Summit in San Francisco.
In this post, I am going to make a list, of five features that we should add to the library to make it faster. We are going to talk about each of these features, and then make a suggestion on how to fix them.
Let’s start with the first feature.
1. Stable Random Numbers
The MLlib random number generator is not stable. This means that if you are using the random number to generate a sequence of numbers, and you are going through a loop, the sequence of random numbers will be the same.
This is not a big deal, but it is a problem when you are doing inference.
To see what I mean, let’ s say you are trying to do
