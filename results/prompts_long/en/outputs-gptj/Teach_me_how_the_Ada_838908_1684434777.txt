Teach me how the Adam optimizer works and give me a quiz at the end, but don’t give me the answers and then tell me if I answered correctly.

I’m not saying Adam is bad. I’ve used it and it works. But I‘m not sure if it’s the best optimizer for all cases.
I think the Adam is a good optimizer, but I don‘t know if it is the best one.
So I‚Äôm asking you to teach me how it works and then give me some examples of how it can fail.
And then I want you to tell me how to do it better.
The Adam optimizers is a very good optimizers, but it can be improved.
It can be made better. It can be optimized.
