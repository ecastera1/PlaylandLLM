Write a poem about shiba inu pet and his master.

Shiba Inu

A dog’s life is a happy one.
He is always smiling and happy.
His master is always there to love him.
Shikadai is a shiba and he is a very good boy.
When he is happy, he is always happy. He is always
smiling and happy and he likes to play with his master
and his master’ s friends.
I will write a poem for shikadaii.
My name is Shikadae.
Today I will write about my master and his dog.
This is my master‘ s dog. He likes to be with me.
We like to play together.
Sometimes he likes me to play fetch.
And sometimes he likes for me to fetch for him. It is fun
to play together like this.
But sometimes he is very naughty.
It is not nice to be naughty. It makes me sad.
So I will not play with him anymore.
Now I will play with my master. He has a very
happy face. He always smiles and he laughs.
If he is sad, he will cry
