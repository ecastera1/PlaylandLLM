Make a list of five Intel CPU features that can help run modern software and improve user experience. Then, explain how each feature is used to improve performance.
Intel CPU features are the building blocks of the Intel Core architecture. They are used to make the CPU more efficient and to increase the speed of the computer. These features are used in the following ways:
• Processor Speed. The processor speed is the number of times the CPU can execute instructions per second. The more processor speed, the faster the computer can run programs. The faster the processor, the more memory the computer has to process data and the more quickly it can make decisions. The Intel Core i7 processor has a speed of up to 3.6 GHz.
• Cache Memory. The cache memory is a small block of memory that the CPU uses to store data that it needs to process. When the CPU needs to access data, it searches the cache memory first. If the data is not in the cache, the CPU will access the main memory. The larger the cache size, the less time the CPU has to access the memory and the faster it can process data. The CPU has a cache memory that can hold up to 4MB of data.
• Hyper-Threading. Hyper- threading is a feature that
