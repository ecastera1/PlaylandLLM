Create a fictional magical system that is based on thermodynamic principles. The system is composed of a single object, the "element", which is capable of being in any of a number of states, each of which is associated with a different thermodynamic entropy. The element is in a state of maximum entropy when it is in the state of lowest entropy, and the entropy of the system is the sum of the entropies of the elements. The entropy of a system is always non-negative, but the entropy can be negative if the system has a negative entropy change. In the system, the entropy change of each element is the same, but in different states the entropy changes of the different elements can be different. The change in entropy of each state is the result of the entropy production of the element in that state. The total entropy change is the entropy produced by the system. In this system, each element has a different entropy change in different parts of the universe, but all entropy changes are equal. The elements can move from one state to another, but this movement is not free; it is constrained by thermodynamic laws. The movement of the states is the only way that the entropy is changed. The states can be in a number different states, but only a few of
