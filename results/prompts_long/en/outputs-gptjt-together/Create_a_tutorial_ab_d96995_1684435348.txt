Create a tutorial about optimizing code performance when using Stable Difussion and PyTorch.

This is a tutorial on how to optimize code performance in PyTorchy. It is a long tutorial, but the goal is to have you understand the concepts and use them in your own code.
I will also be using theano and tensorflow for the examples.
The tutorial will be divided into two parts, the first part will be about Stable Distillation, the second part will discuss how to use StableDistillation in your code. 

## StableDifussion

Stable Distilltion is a technique for training neural networks that allows the network to be trained faster and allows it to be more efficient.
It is based on the idea that a neural network can be trained to make an error in a specific range.
For example, if you want to train a network to recognize dogs, you can train it to recognize the different breeds of dogs.
However, you cannot train a neural net to recognize all the different dogs, because the error is too large.
You can train a net to identify a dog, but if it makes a mistake, it will be very wrong.
This can be solved by training
