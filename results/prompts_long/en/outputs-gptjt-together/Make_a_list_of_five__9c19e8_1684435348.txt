Make a list of five Stable Difussion features that should improve to make inference faster.

I have a list with the following features:

-   Stable diffusion

This is the feature that makes the inference faster, but it is not always stable.
The problem is that the gradient is not stable. When the gradient changes, the
parameters change.
I want to make a list that includes the following:
- Stable gradient

Stable gradient is the gradient that is stable. I want to have a
list that includes this feature.
- Fast gradient
- Gradient is fast

The gradient is fast because it is stable and the inference is fast.
This feature is not necessary for the list, but I want it to be included.
It is important to have this feature because the gradient can change
and the parameters will change. That is, the gradient will be stable and
the parameters will be fast. The inference will be faster. I do not
know if this feature is important, but if it is, I want a list including
it.
Make a short list of the following Stable and Fast features: 

1. Stable Gradient
2.
