Create a YAML template to detect Magento version for the Nuclei vulnerability scanner.

Magento 2.2.x and 2.3.x are vulnerable to a remote code execution attack when the website is accessed with a user-agent string that includes the string “Chrome”.
This is because the website uses a PHP extension that is not properly configured, which allows attackers to inject code into the website.
The Magento 2 vulnerability is assigned CVE-2018-12271 and the Magento 1 vulnerability is CVE-2017-7195.
Magneto 2.1.x, 2.0.x is not vulnerable.
In addition, Magento is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack, when the URL includes the parameter “/index.php/admin/index/key/” and the parameter is not filtered.
For more information, please see the Magentos security advisory.
