Create a fictional magical system that is based on thermodynamic principles.

Thermodynamic laws are the foundation of the universe. They govern everything in it, from the smallest particle to the largest star. They are the laws of nature, and they are the basis of all magical systems.
Thermal magic is a branch of magic that is centered on the principles of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics is the study of the transfer of energy and matter in the universe, and it is the basis for all magical practice. Thermal magic can be used to create a magical system based on the laws and principles of the natural universe.
