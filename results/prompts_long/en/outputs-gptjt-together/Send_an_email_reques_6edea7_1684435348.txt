Send an email requesting prompter action from recipients.PromptedAction

Send an Email

Prompts to send an email to recipients.

Email Address

The email address of the recipient.
The default is the email address associated with the user.
If you have a custom email address, you can specify it here.
For example, if you have an email address that looks like this:
myemail@mydomain.com
you can specify the email here as myemail@otherdomain.
This will send the email to the email associated with this user. If you do not specify an email, the email will be sent to the default email address.
You can also specify an alternate email address here. For example, you may have a second email address for your business.
In that case, you would specify the alternate email here. This will send an alternate copy of the email.
Note that the email addresses specified here are the email accounts associated with your domain.
They are not the email account associated with an individual user. For instance, if a user has an email account at myemail.com, you cannot specify myemail as the email in the prompt.
Instead, you must specify the user's
