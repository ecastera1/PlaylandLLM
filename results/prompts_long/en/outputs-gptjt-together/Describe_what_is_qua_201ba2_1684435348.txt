The History of Electronic Computing is a book by David Gelernter, published in 1989 by MIT Press. It is a detailed account of the history and development of electronic computers from their inception in the late 19th century to the present. Gelernuter is a professor of computer science at Yale University.
The book is available for free download in PDF format from the Internet Archive.
In the book Gelernater discusses the history, design, and development, of electronic digital computers.
Gelernter explains how the first electronic digital computer was invented by the American engineer and inventor, Herman Hollerith, in 1891.
Hollerith's machine was an electromechanical device that tabulated punch cards.
It was the first computer to be used for business purposes.
By the late 1920s, electronic computers were being used for military purposes. The book also explains how World War II led to the development of the first transistor-based electronic computer, the ENIAC.
After the war, electronic computing was used for scientific purposes. It was not until the 1960s that electronic computing became widely used for
